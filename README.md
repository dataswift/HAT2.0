# [Hub of All Things](https://hubofallthings.com)

 This repository contains an implementation of the [Hub-of-All-Things](http://hubofallthings.com) HAT Microserver project.

## Releases

The current project version is [here](https://github.com/dataswift/HAT2.0/releases).

## About the project

The Hub-of-All-Things is a HAT Microserver for individuals to own, control and share their data.

A Personal Microserver (“the HAT”) is a personal single tenant (“the individual self”) technology system that is fully individual self-service, to enable an individual to define a full set of “meta-data” defined as a specific set of personal data, personal preferences and personal behaviour events. 

The HAT enables individuals to share the correct information (quality and quantity), with the correct people, in the correct situations for the correct purposes and to gain the benefits.


## Technology stack

This HAT Microserver implementation is written in Scala (2.12.11) uses the following technology stack:

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) relational database (version 9.5)
- [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com) (version 2.6)
- [Akka](https://akka.io) (version 2.5)
- [Slick](https://scala-slick.org/) as the database access layer (version 3.2)

## Running the project - Either via docker-compose (recommended) or building locally

### 1. Get the Source and the submodules for both of the methods

    > git clone https://github.com/Hub-of-all-Things/HAT2.0.git
    > cd HAT2.0
    > git submodule init 
    > git submodule update

### 2. Configure your /etc/hosts

    127.0.0.1   bobtheplumber.hat.org
    127.0.0.1   bobtheplumber.example.com
    

### 3a. Using docker-compose
    
    > cd <DIRECTORY_YOU_CHECKED_OUT_INTO>/deployment/docker
    > docker-compose up
   

When the build finishes, open [`https://bobtheplumber.example.com:9001`](https://bobtheplumber.example.com:9001) in a browser.
Standard account login password is `testing`.

### 3b. Building locally


### HAT Setup

HAT runs as a combination of a backing PostgreSQL database (with a 
[public schema](https://github.com/Hub-of-all-Things/hat-database-schema) 
for flattened data storage) and a software stack that provides logic to
work with the schema using HTTP APIs.

To run it from source in a development environment two sets of tools are required:

- PostgreSQL database and utilities
- [Scala Build Tool](https://www.scala-sbt.org) (SBT)

To launch the HAT, follow these steps:

1. Create the database, which we assume is available as `localhost`:
    ```bash
    > createdb testhatdb1
    > createuser testhatdb1
    > psql postgres -c "GRANT CREATE ON DATABASE testhatdb1 TO testhatdb1"
    ```
2. Compile the project:
    ```bash
    > make dev
    ```
3. Add custom local domain mapping to your `/etc/hosts` file. This will make sure when you go to the defined address from your machine you will be pointed back to your own machine. E.g.:
    ```
    127.0.0.1   bobtheplumber.hat.org
    127.0.0.1   bobtheplumber.example.com
    ```
4. Run the project:
    ```bash
    > make run-dev
    ```
5. Go to [http://bobtheplumber.example.com:9000](http://bobtheplumber.example.com:9000)

**You're all set!**

### Customising your development environment

Your best source of information on how the development environment could
be customised is the `hat/conf/dev.conf` configuration file. Make sure you
run the project locally with the configuration enabled (using the steps above)
or it will just show you the message that the HAT could not be found.

Among other things, the configuration includes:

- host names alongside port numbers of the test HATs ([http://yourname.hat.org:9000](http://yourname.hat.org:9000))
- access credentials used to log in as the owner or restricted platform user into the HAT (the default password is a very unsafe *testing*)
- database connection details (important if you want to change your database setup above)
- private and public keys used for token signing and verification  

Specifically, it has 4 major sections:

- Enables the development environment self-initialisation module:
    ```
    play.modules {
      enabled += "org.hatdex.hat.modules.DevHatInitializationModule"
    }
    ```
- Sets the list of database evolutions to be executed on initialisation:
    ```
    devhatMigrations = [
      "evolutions/hat-database-schema/11_hat.sql",
      "evolutions/hat-database-schema/12_hatEvolutions.sql",
      "evolutions/hat-database-schema/13_liveEvolutions.sql",
      "evolutions/hat-database-schema/14_newHat.sql"]
    ```  
- `devhats` list sets out the list of HATs that are served by the current server, for 
each including owner details to be initialised with and database access
credentials. Each specified database must exist before launching the server
but are initialised with the right schema at start time
- `hat` section lists all corresponding HAT configurations to serve, here
you could change the HAT domain name, owner's email address or public/private
keypair used by the HAT for its token operations

## Using docker-compose

We have put together a [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) file that will allow you to run a PostgreSQL node and a HAT node easily.

###  Get the Source and the submodules

    > git clone https://github.com/Hub-of-all-Things/HAT2.0.git
    > cd HAT2.0
    > git submodule init 
    > git submodule update
    > cd deployment/docker
    > docker-compose up
    > open [https://bobtheplumber.example:9001](https://bobtheplumber.example:9001)

 

## Additional information

- API documentation can be found at the [developers' portal](https://developers.hubofallthings.com)
- [HAT Database Schema](https://github.com/Hub-of-all-Things/hat-database-schema) has been split up into a separate project for easier reuse across different environments.
